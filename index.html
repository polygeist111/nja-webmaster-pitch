                Heyo, my name's Thalia (she/her)! Many of you may know me as Polygeist, Bone Eater (not the Californian one), or Loot Bug. I've been a part of this great community for a few years now, playing with the Elementals in the PNW and the Feathered Serpents in AZ, and my goal is to give back to this community as your NJA Webmaster.
                In addition to moderating the NJA Discord, the next Webmaster is also charged with leading the development of an official NJA website.
                <br>&emsp;I'm a Computer Science student in my third year at ASU, with a particular interest in web development. In addition to my <a href="https://polygeist111.github.io/portfolio-site/about.html" target="_blank">personal site</a> (fully scratch-built), I've also helped to develop, expand, and maintain <a href="https://www.archetyp.com/" target="_blank">Archetyp Alpine Wines'</a> site.
                With my experience with these and other projects, and several years heavily involved in the national jugger community, I think I'm the right jugger for the job.
            </p>

                What could we accomplish with an NJA website? Of course, having a public face will help with recruitment and club registration for school-affiliated teams, but an NJA website could be used to do so much more!
                In addition to all the essentials of an NJA site (Rules, About Us, How to Play, History), if elected, I would work to implement:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>An open-source crafting forum</strong>, where juggers can share resources and knowledge on how to build all the gear we know and love in a more easily referenced format than the discord. (I'll also personally contribute a full illustrated guide on building each piece of gear)</li>
                    <li><strong>A national media archive</strong>, to store and view highlighted media from every official NJA event</li>
                    <li><strong>A national tournament archive</strong>, including final placements, brackets, rosters, and scores of every tournament</li>
                    <li><strong>A platform for the artists and foamsmiths in our community</strong>, including art contests, commission boards, and potentially a merch store to expand NJA funding channels</li>
                    <li><strong>A suite of opt-in tools for tournament organizers</strong>, including streamlined registration and payment, online brackets, and scheduling and announcements</li>
                    <li><strong>Whatever the community needs!</strong></li>
                </ul>
            <p class="introBlockText">
                <br>
                These are just a few ways to build our community further and draw us together, and a number of them are community initiatives (special acknowledgement to Rat for the artist's platform). As your Webmaster, I'd work to support your community initiatives too.
                Jugger is a community and a team sportâ€”we all thrive when we work together. An NJA website presents countless opportunities to pool knowledge, stories, and our history, for all of our benefit. <span class="emphasizedText">Vote for me, Thalia Wood</span>, to see those opportunities made real.
